# 2D-domain-adpatation
Implement unsupervise domain adpatation models for object detection on industrial data to achieve assembly quality insecption. The models will be trained on synthetic data generated from Industrail CAD models, and make prediction on data captured from the real production line. 


## 1. PointNet comparasion
Using pointnet++ to train on synthetic point cloud generated from Industrail CAD models, and make prediction on point cloud captured from the real production line.
In order to compare 3D and 2D classification.  

The introduction of running the code is in pointnet++.

## 2. Faster RCNN
Unsupervised learning: Using faster rcnn to train on synthetic images generated from Industrial CAD models, and make prediction on images captured from the real production line. 
Supervised learning: Using faster rcnn to detect images from the real production line.

The step is to set the baseline of 2D domain adpatation.
The introduction of running the code is in Faster RCNN.
