# 2D-domain-adpatation
Implement unsupervise domain adpatation models for object detection on industrial data to achieve assembly quality insecption. The models will be trained on synthetic data generated from Industrail CAD models, and make prediction on data captured from the real production line. 


## Step 1. PointNet comparasion
Using pointnet++ to train on synthetic point cloud generated from Industrail CAD models, and make prediction on point cloud captured from the real production line.
In order to compare 3D and 2D classification.
